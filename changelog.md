## Development Rules

### **Cell-by-Cell Execution Protocol:**
1. Provide one cell code at a time
2. User executes cell in Colab
3. User shares output/errors
4. Confirm success or debug
5. Proceed to next cell
6. Complete each day before moving forward

### **Code Standards:**
- Clear comments in every cell
- Error handling in all functions
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Modular, reusable functions
- Save checkpoints frequently

### **Quality Checks:**
- Validate data after each transformation
- Check for null values and data leakage
- Verify feature consistency
- Test predictions make sense
- Log all important operations

## Current Status

**Overall Progress:** 0/7 Days Completed

**Next Steps:**
1. User confirms they're ready to start DAY 1
2. Begin with environment setup cell
3. Execute one cell at a time
4. Share outputs for validation
5. Proceed systematically through all 7 days
