## Technical Workflow

### **Development (Days 1-7):**
```
1. Open daily notebook in Colab
2. Mount Google Drive
3. Execute cells one by one (with confirmation)
4. Files auto-save to Drive
5. Commit notebook to GitHub
```

### **Weekly Usage (After Development):**
```
1. Open master_execution.ipynb in Colab
2. Mount Google Drive
3. Run "Input New Matchday Results" cell
4. Run "Update & Retrain" cell
5. Run "Generate New Predictions" cell
6. View updated predictions
```

---

## Development Rules

### **Cell-by-Cell Execution Protocol:**
1. Provide one cell code at a time
2. User executes cell in Colab
3. User shares output/errors
4. Confirm success or debug
5. Proceed to next cell
6. Complete each day before moving forward

### **Code Standards:**
- Clear comments in every cell
- Error handling in all functions
- Progress indicators for long operations
- All code in notebooks (no separate .py files)
- Save checkpoints to Google Drive frequently

### **Quality Checks:**
- Validate data after each transformation
- Check for null values and data leakage
- Verify feature consistency
- Test predictions make sense
- Log all important operations

---

## Current Status

**Overall Progress:** 0/7 Days Completed (0%)

**Next Steps:**
1. User confirms ready to start DAY 1
2. Begin with Cell 1: Mount Drive & create folders
3. Execute one cell at a time
4. Share outputs for validation
5. Proceed systematically through all 7 days
